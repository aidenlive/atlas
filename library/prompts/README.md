# Prompt Library

**78 reusable request prompts across 14 lifecycle categories**,
governed by [`spec/library.md`](../../spec/library.md) (rules L-01..L-08).

## Usage

Copy any prompt into your AI tool of choice, or hand it to a colleague —
optionally appending specifics ("…for the payments-api repo"). Prompts state
*intent and constraints*; the standards in [`spec/`](../../spec/) carry the how.
Agents can discover the catalog machine-readably via [`index.yaml`](index.yaml).

Prompts for destructive operations (deprecation, offboarding, releases,
deletion) embed plan-before-act gates by design (L-04). Do not strip them.

## Conventions

- Naming: `request-<verb>-<object>.txt`, lowercase kebab-case (L-07).
- One objective, 1–3 sentences, tool-agnostic (L-01..L-03).
- Edits are PRs: review a prompt like you review a convention. If a prompt
  routinely needs local tweaks, fix it here, not in sixty pasted copies.
- CI keeps files and `index.yaml` mutually complete (L-08).
